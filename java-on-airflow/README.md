### How to build the Java on Airflow demo

The code in this repo is used to showcase how you can package up Java code in a container image, and then run this via an Airflow Operator. To demostrate this we need some demo code that does something, in this case we run a SQL query against a MySQL database, and then store the output of that as a CSV file in an Amazon S3 bucket. Pretty typical stuff, and enough to show you how the key pieces work.

**Building the Java on Airflow Container**

You can build the container by running the following command from the java-on-airflow directory

```
docker build -t java-on-airflow .
```
Which should generate output similar to the following

You can now run the Java script using the following command

```
docker run  java-on-airflow
```
Which should ouput the following:
```
Usage: java DatabaseToS3Exporter <db-server> <db-name> <sql-query> <s3-bucket-name> <aws-region> <secret-arn>
```

**Uploading to the container image repository**

I have provided a simple script that automates the building and pushing of this container image to a container image repository running on Amazon ECR. To run, first edit the setup.sh file in the java-on-airflow directory (you will need to update your AWS account details, AWS region, etc - its pretty simple) and then you can simply use the following command from the command line to run everything

```
./setup.sh
```

you should get something similar to this

```

**Local Setup**

You can run/test locally, although the script does use AWS to 1/grab secrets information to connect to the MySQL database, 2/upload the query in csv format. You could change the Java code to do this differently if you wanted.

To run this against a local MySQL instance, I used the following to first start a local MySQL test instance.

```
docker run --name mysql -d \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=change-me \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    mysql:8
````
I then updated the username/password in the AWS Secrets Manager.
